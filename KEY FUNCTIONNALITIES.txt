Deployment of a service and access control:

    When deploying a Service on the Ikwen platform, the person deploying must be set as superuser in his database
    as well as IAO. His collaborates_on field must be properly set.


Deployment of ikwen itself.
    InvoicingConfig must be create in the database.


Permissions
    Custom created permissions in an ikwen app must start with the prefix "ik_". This prefix differentiates from
    default created permissions. Only permissions with codename starting with "ik_" will show up in collaborators
    management panel.
    Following permissions must absolutely exist:
        accesscontrol.ik_manage_customers:  Collaborator granted this permission can manage customers.


Deployment of billing app.
    - Only one billing app may be deployed per domain, to avoid confusion in InvoicingConfig. The same way
    only one InvoicingConfig is allowed per billing deployment. Others will be ignored
    - DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE must be properly set in ikwen.foundation.billing.crons


Deployment scripts.
    404.html and 500.html located in core/templates must be copied to the root templates folder to override
    django defaults one.


Collaborators.
    This version limits the number of collaborators to 50. Mainly because it takes away the need to care
    about page navigation in collaborators admin page that is tabbed. Page navigation with tabs would cause
    the need to inject the current tab when querying the datasource and replacing page navigation counters.
    That is simply useless for a platform that is mainly aimed at small and medium size companies.
